                 <p>Perhaps the graetest detective of All Time!</p>
                 <p>The man is easily 6' in height and lean, yet has good force in his arms. The man is extremely perceptive, can tell a lot about you by just observing for under a minute. The observations may seem bizarre at first, but when he explains his reasoning, one finds that they could have done it by <STRONG>keeping their eyes and ears open</STRONG>.</p>
                 <p>He is definitely not a show-off, but he also doesn't know humility. He can put someone right at his/her place and can also admire someone who is indeed worth his admiration. He considers his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycroft_Holmes"><strong>Mycroft Holmes</strong></a>, to be better than him not because of his 'humility' as suggested by Dr. Watson, but because it is the truth. But the brother is depicted as lazy and ambition-less in solving criminal cases.</p>
                 <p>His persona is what makes him so interesting. He LOVES facts. He wants even the smallest, most insignificant detail as it may seem, to the common man. He doesn't like to be disturbed (not even the slightest sound!) when he is at work. He has his magnifying glass with which observes even a small cigarette butt which might have fallen in the grass just outside a window of a house, or some horse hoofs which are not usually visible.</p>
                 <p>Another most attractive and also the most annoying trait of his is that, except his subjects of interest, he knows nothing and doesn't care about them. Whether the Sun goes about the Earth or who the current Prime Minister of the country is, it just doesn't matter to him. According to him, the <strong><em>'mind-attic'</em></strong> should be stuffed with only the necessary things. Other things just confuse a person from his main goals. This according to him has resulted in all the fools walking around in the country.</p>
                 <p>When he is not with any case, he becomes paranoid and goes about researching obscure things, like the different kinds of cigarette ash that exist and what all <strong><em>decudtions</em></strong> can be made from them. The man is fond of chemistry, and often conducts experiments to find out interesting things. He also has a perfect memory of every criminal case that had ever occurred.</p>
                 <p>But however self-centred and sociopathic he may seem, he is a good man. He loves Dr. Watson as a brother, and in his humanity is seen in some of the cases that are solved by him.</p>
