                  <p>This is where it all started !</p>
                  <p>Sherlock Holmes brings the recently retired Dr. John Watson from the British Army to check out the flat they were going to share, with Mrs. Hudson as the landlady.</p>
                  <p>This is where Dr. Watson introduces the readers to the personality of the famous detective. The drawing room is filled with various kinds of stuffs, starting from a big shelf of books, to Holmes' pipes, to various other objects that are strewn along the ground. The room is dirty as Sherlock Holmes is not very much for cleanliness, and likes things to be <strong>exactly where they are</strong>. I think that there . </p>
